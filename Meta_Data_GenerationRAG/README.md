# Metadata Generation System with Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This project implements a metadata generation system using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a vector database. The system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of generated metadata. We have used Llama2 LLM model for Meta Data Generation using FAISS and RAGs 

## FAISS Integration

The metadata generation system utilizes FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient vector indexing and similarity search. Here are some key points about FAISS integration:

- **Efficient Vector Indexing:** FAISS provides optimized algorithms and data structures for indexing high-dimensional vectors. This enables the system to quickly organize and retrieve vectors stored in the vector database.

- **Fast Similarity Search:** FAISS offers fast and scalable similarity search algorithms, allowing the system to retrieve vectors similar to a given query vector with high efficiency. This is crucial for the retrieval-augmented generation process, as it ensures quick access to relevant information from the vector database.

- **Scalability:** FAISS is designed to handle large datasets of high-dimensional vectors efficiently. As the metadata generation system grows and accumulates more data, FAISS ensures that the retrieval process remains fast and scalable.

- **Ease of Integration:** FAISS provides a user-friendly interface and straightforward integration with Python, making it easy to incorporate into the metadata generation system.

By leveraging FAISS, the system enhances its capability to retrieve and utilize relevant information from the vector database, ultimately improving the quality and relevance of the generated metadata.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The metadata generation system utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of generated metadata. Here's why RAG is beneficial for our system:

- **Contextual Relevance:** RAG allows the model to generate metadata that is contextually relevant by incorporating information retrieved from a database. This ensures that the generated content is coherent and aligned with the user's query.

- **Improved Quality:** By combining information retrieval with language generation, RAG enhances the quality of generated metadata. The retrieved information provides additional context to the model, resulting in more accurate and informative responses.

- **Diverse Responses:** RAG enables the system to produce diverse metadata by leveraging information from the database. This helps in generating a variety of content that meets the diverse needs and preferences of users.

- **Handling Ambiguity:** RAG helps in handling ambiguous queries by retrieving relevant information from the database. This ensures that the generated metadata is clear and precise, even in cases where the input query lacks sufficient context.

- **Scalability:** RAG techniques are designed to scale efficiently with large datasets and growing demands. This makes them suitable for applications that require generating metadata at scale, such as our metadata generation system.

- **Adaptability:** RAG can be adapted to various tasks and domains, making it a versatile framework for metadata generation. Whether it's generating metadata for documents, images, or other types of data, RAG can be customized to suit different use cases.

By incorporating RAG techniques into our metadata generation system, we enhance its capability to generate high-quality, contextually relevant, and diverse metadata, ultimately improving the user experience and utility of the system.
